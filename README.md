# Vibes

Vibes adds a new item, the Vibe, that lets you play music discs on the go without needing a jukebox.

Vibes try to position their music logically, which means that putting a Vibe inside a chest while it's still playing will move the sound source to the chest's position. This not only works with chests, but with all vanilla storage blocks, storage minecarts, shulker boxes, and item frames.

Dropping a Vibe on the ground will move the sound source to the item entity, and picking it up will move the sound source to the position of the player that picked it up.
